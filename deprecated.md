{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} is a third-party cloud-native, and container-intelligence management system that you can include as part of your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} architecture. Use it to gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your applications, services, and platforms. It offers administrators, DevOps teams and developers full stack telemetry with advanced features to monitor and troubleshoot, define alerts, and design custom dashboards. {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} is operated by Sysdig in partnership with {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. [Learn more](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-getting-started).

You can use {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} to monitor different platforms, applications, and services. For example, [you can monitor metrics that are exposed by enabled-Sysdig services and the platform in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-platform_metrics_enabling). [You can monitor Kubernetes clusters](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-getting-started#step5).
