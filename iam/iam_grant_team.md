# Granting permissions to work within the context of a team
{: #iam_grant_team}

{{site.data.keyword.iamlong}} (IAM) enables you to securely authenticate users and control access to all cloud resources consistently in the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. Complete the following steps to grant a user or service ID administration permissions to work with the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service within the context of a team:
{:shortdesc}



## Prerequisites
{: #iam_grant_team_prereq}

Your user ID needs **administrator platform permissions** to manage the {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} service. Contact the account administrator. The account owner can grant another user access to the account for the purposes of managing user access, and managing account resources. [Learn more](/docs/account?topic=account-userroles).


## Step 1. Create an access group
{: #iam_grant_team_step1}

Complete the following steps to create an access group:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Access Groups**.
2. Click **Create**.
3. Enter a name and optional description for your group, and click **Create**.

You can delete a group by selecting the **Remove group** option. When you remove a group from the account, you are removing all users and service IDs from the group and all access that is assigned to the group.
{: note}

To create an access group by using the CLI, you can use the [ibmcloud iam access-group-create](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_access_group_create) command.

```
ibmcloud iam access-group-create GROUP_NAME [-d, --description DESCRIPTION]
```
{: codeblock}




## Step 2. Add permissions to view {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} instances in the Observability UI
{: #iam_grant_team_step2}

After you set up your group, you can assign a common access policy to the group. You must add permissions to view {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} instances in the Observability UI. 

Any policy that you set for an access group applies to all entities, users, and service IDs, within the group. 
{: note}

You can assign the policy by using the UI or through the command line. 

When you define the policy, you need to select a platform role. Platform management roles cover a range of actions, including the ability to create and delete instances, manage aliases, bindings, and credentials, and manage access. Valid platform roles are administrator, editor, operator, viewer. 


### Add permissions through the CLI
{: #iam_grant_team_step2_1}

To create an access group policy by using the CLI, you can use the [ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_access_group_policy_create) command with the **viewer** role.

```
ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create GROUP_NAME {-f, --file @JSON_FILE | --roles ROLE_NAME1,ROLE_NAME2... [--service-name SERVICE_NAME] [--service-instance SERVICE_INSTANCE] [--region REGION] [--resource-type RESOURCE_TYPE] [--resource RESOURCE] [--resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID]}
```
{: codeblock}

For example, you can run the following command to grant a user viewer permissions:

```
ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create my-access-group --roles Viewer --service-name my-monitoring-instance --service-instance 99999999-9999-9999-999999
```
{: codeblock}


### Add permissions through the UI
{: #iam_grant_team_step2_2}

Complete the following steps to assign a policy to an access group through the UI:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Access Groups**.
2. Select the name of the group  &gt;that you want to assign access to. 
3. Click **Access policies**  &gt; **Assign access**  &gt; **Assign access to resources**.
4. Select **IAM services**.
5. In the section *What type of access do you want to assign?*, select **{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}**.
6. In the section *Which services do you want to assign access to?*, choose one of the following options:

    Select **All services** to define the scope of the policy to include all instances.

    Select **Services based on attributes** to refine the scope of the policy. Choose 1 of the following options:
    
    Option1: The scope is set to a resource group. Select **Resource group** to choose 1 resource group and define the scope of the policy to include all instances that are associated with that resource group. 

    Option 2: The scope is set to 1 instance in a resource group. Select **Resource group** to choose the resource group. Then select **Service Instance** to choose the instance within the resource group.
    
    Option 3: The scope is set to 1 instance. Select **Service Instance** to choose the instance.

    Skip configuring a value in the *Sysdig Team* section.
    {: important}

7. Select the **viewer** platform role.

8. Click **Assign**.



## Step 3. Add permissions to work in a team
{: #iam_grant_team_step3}

Next, you must add a policy that grant the user permissions to work with data in the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} service within the context of a team.

When you define the policy, you need to select a service role. Service access roles define a user or serviceâ€™s ability to perform actions on a service instance. The service access roles are manager, writer, and reader.


### Add permissions through the CLI
{: #iam_grant_team_step3_1}

To create an access group policy by using the CLI, you can use the [ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_iam#ibmcloud_iam_access_group_policy_create) command.

```
ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create GROUP_NAME {-f, --file @JSON_FILE | --roles ROLE_NAME1,ROLE_NAME2... [--service-name SERVICE_NAME] [--service-instance SERVICE_INSTANCE] [--region REGION] [--resource-type RESOURCE_TYPE] [--resource RESOURCE] [--resource-group-name RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME] [--resource-group-id RESOURCE_GROUP_ID]}
```
{: codeblock}

Where valid roles are `Reader`, `Writer`, and `Manager`.

You must use a JSON file to create the team policy.
{: important}

For example, you can run the following command:

```
ibmcloud iam access-group-policy-create accessGroupName accessGroupGUID --file policy.json
```
{: codeblock}

Where 

* `accessGroupName` is the access group name.
* `accessGroupGUID` is the GUID of the access group.

You can run the command `ibmcloud iam access-groups` to get the list of names and corresponding GUIDs in the account.
{: tip}

And use the following JSON file. 

```json
{
    "type": "access",
    "subjects": [
        {
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "name": "access_group_id",
                    "value": "AccessGroupGuid"
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "roles" : [
    {
            "role_id" : "crn:v1:bluemix:public:iam::::serviceRole:Reader"
    }
    ],
    "resources": [
        {
            "attributes": [
                {
                    "name": "accountId",
                    "value": "accountGuid"
                },
                {
                    "name": "serviceName",
                    "value": "sysdig-monitor"
                },
                {
                    "name": "serviceInstance",
                    "value": "instanceGuid"
                },
                {
                    "name": "sysdigTeam",
                    "value": "sysdigTeamID"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
{: codeblock}


### Add permissions through the UI
{: #iam_grant_team_step3_2}

Complete the following steps to assign a policy to an access group through the UI:

1. From the menu bar, click **Manage** &gt; **Access (IAM)**, and select **Access Groups**.
2. Select the name of the group  &gt;that you want to assign access to. 
3. Click **Access policies**  &gt; **Assign access**  &gt; **Assign access to resources**.
4. Select **IAM services**.
5. In the section *What type of access do you want to assign?*, select **{{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}**.
6. In the section *Which services do you want to assign access to?*, complete the following steps:

    First, select **Services based on attributes** to refine the scope of the policy. Choose 1 of the following options:

    Option 1: Set the scope to 1 instance in a resource group. Select **Resource group** to choose the resource group. Then select **Service Instance** to choose the instance within the resource group.
    
    Option 2: Set the scope to 1 instance. Select **Service Instance** to choose the instance.

    Next, select a **Sysdig team**.

7. Select a service role. The service role defines the permissions a user has to view and manage resources in that team.

    Select **manager** to grant admin permissions for the service.

    Select **reader** to grant permissions to view data only.

    [Learn more about the roles that you need](/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-iam).
