# Monitoring your environment
{: #monitoring}

After you provision an instance of the IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig service in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}}, and configure a Sysdig agent for a metrics source, you can view, monitor, and manage metrics through the IBM Cloud Monitoring with Sysdig Web UI.
{:shortdesc}


After you configure your agents, data is automatically collected. YOu can use the Explore tab to monitor your data by using default metrics and default dasshboards. Explain Expore tab.


Default metrics are automatically collected.
You can add custom metrics and labels

then you can:
1. Add custom metrics
2. Add custom labels
3. Group data by using the metrics labels
4. Aggregate data
5. Filter data.

which you can see through the Explore tab.

You can also create new Dashboards where you can leverage  the  new groups, segments, and metrics.

You can also enable events and define alerts.

Use dashboards to monitor your infrastructure, applications, and services. 
{: tip}

A **dashboard** shows groups of metrics that report on the health, performance, and state of your infrastructure, applications, and services for a single host or a group of hosts. Dashboards offer a specialized insight into network data, application data, topology, services, hosts, and containers.

In the **DASHBOARDS** section of the Web UI, dashboards are organized into three main groups:

* *My Dashboards*: These are the dashboards that are created by the user who is currently logged in.
* *My Shared Dashboards*: These are the dashboards that are created by the user who is currently logged in, and that are shared with other users.
* *Dashboards Shared With Me*: These are the dashboards that are created by other users, and shared with the current user.

In the **EXPLORE** section of the Web UI, dashboards are organized into two groups:
* *Default dashboards*: These are the pre-defined dashboards.
* *My Dashboards*: These are the dashboards that are created by the user who is currently logged in.


You can use pre-defined dashboards. You can also create custom dashboards through the Web UI or programmatically. You can backup and restore dashboards by using Python scripts.

You can copy and share dashboards through the Web UI. 

You can run scripts to complete any of the following actions programmatically:
* Save existing dashboards to a local file.
* Create new dashboards that are identical to the dashboards that you save.
* Restore dashboards.
