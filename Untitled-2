# Notifications
{: #events}

Use dashboards to monitor your infrastructure, applications, and services. You can use pre-defined dashboards. You can also create custom dashboards through the Web UI or programmatically.

There are two primary types of events displayed in the Events module: alert events, and custom events.


## Alert Events
{: #alert}

Alert events are events triggered by user-configured alerts. For more information on configuring alerts, refer to the Alerts documentation.



## Custom Events
{: #custom}

Custom events include infrastructure-based events (for example, Docker and Kubernetes), and other events configured by the user through integrations.
Infrastructure-Based Events

Infrastructure-based events are pulled from infrastructure components. Sysdig currently supports infrastructure-based events from the following components:

    Docker
    Kubernetes

The Sysdig agent will automatically discover these services and begin collecting event data from them. The agent is configured by default to collect a select group of events automatically; others can be added by editing the agent configuration file.
