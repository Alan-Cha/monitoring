Complete the following steps to create a team:

    * Set the **Default Entry Point** to specify the view in the web UI that opens every time a user logs in. Valid entrypoints are: *Explore* view, *Dashboards* view, *Events* view, *Alerts* view, and *Settings* view. By default, the *Explore* view is set.

6. Configure the team scope. 

    * [Optional] Set **Scope by** to specify the level of data that members of the team have access to. Valid values are *host* and *container*.
